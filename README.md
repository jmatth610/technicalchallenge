## Part 1: Cybersecurity Scenario

### Task 1 – Threat Intelligence Report

Web applications with unpatched vulnerabilities are targets for attacks like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Remote Code Execution (RCE). To prevent these, regularly update software, conduct security tests, and use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Tools like Azure Defender and AWS Security Hub are helpful for advanced threat detection and automated responses.

### Task 2 – Incident Response Plan

To address a security breach, follow these steps: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Utilize cloud tools like Azure Defender or AWS Security Hub to enhance monitoring and threat detection capabilities.

### Task 3 – Network Security Measures

Enhance network security with Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), firewalls, and network segmentation. Conduct regular audits and provide employee training. Leverage tools like Azure Defender and AWS Security Hub for continuous monitoring and automated responses.

## Part 2: Container Security Implementation

### Task 1 – Docker Security Best Practices

Ensure Docker security by using official images, minimizing the attack surface with minimal base images, running containers as non-root users, implementing multi-stage builds, and regularly scanning images for vulnerabilities. Refer to the `Dockerfile` in the repo for implementation details.

### Task 2 – Kubernetes Security Configuration

Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), network policies, and Pod Security Policies (PSPs) to enhance Kubernetes security. Refer to the `secure-pod.yaml` file in the repo for configuration details.

### Task 3 – IaaS Security Measures

Understand the shared responsibility model in IaaS. Ensure data security through encryption, manage access with IAM policies, and use network security practices like VPCs and security groups. Continuous monitoring and logging are essential for maintaining a secure environment.

## Part 3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### Task 1 – Configuration Management with Puppet

Install Puppet and create a manifest to deploy a web server. The `webserver.pp` file in the repo contains the necessary code. Apply the manifest using `puppet apply webserver.pp` to automate the deployment.

### Task 2 – GitHub Actions for AWS

Set up AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets. Create a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy a serverless application to AWS Lambda, including linting and testing steps. Refer to the `ci-cd.yml` file in the repo for the workflow configuration.
